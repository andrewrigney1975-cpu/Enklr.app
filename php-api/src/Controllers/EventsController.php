/**
 * One long-lived Server-Sent Events stream per browser tab, covering every project the caller is a
 * member of — the PHP-FPM equivalent of Controllers/EventsController.cs. Authenticated the same way
 * as every other endpoint (bearer JWT); deliberately NOT the native EventSource API client-side,
 * since EventSource can't send an Authorization header — src/js/features/live-updates.js drives this
 * via fetch + ReadableStream instead, and needs zero changes to talk to this tier vs the .NET one.
 *
 * Unlike the .NET side's in-memory SseBroadcaster (a single-process registry), every mutation here
 * publishes via Postgres NOTIFY (see Realtime/Broadcaster.php) and every open stream runs its own
 * dedicated `LISTEN task_changed` connection, filtering incoming payloads for itself by the
 * memberUserIds/excludeClientSessionId embedded in each notification. This needs the raw ext-pgsql
 * driver (pg_connect/pg_get_notify) rather than PDO, since PDO_PGSQL doesn't expose an async
 * notification wait primitive — ext-pgsql is a standard companion to pdo_pgsql on any PHP install
 * capable of running this tier at all.
