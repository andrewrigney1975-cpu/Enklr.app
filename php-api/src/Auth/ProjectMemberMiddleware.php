/**
 * ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md finding 2.4 (.NET tier), ported here: reads the route's {projectId} and
 * checks it against a LIVE "ProjectMembers" row, not the JWT's baked-in "projects" claim — that claim
 * is minted once at login and never re-queried, so removing a user from a project used to have no
 * effect until their token expired/they logged in again (up to the full 8h JWT lifetime), a real
 * staleness window for a governance tool where offboarding access changes are sometimes urgent. This
 * mirrors the same "server-side re-validation, never trust the client's embedded claim" idiom the
 * cross-org-isolation pattern already establishes elsewhere in this codebase — the JWT is still
 * trusted for WHO the caller is (the "sub" claim, checked elsewhere), just not for what they're
 * currently a member of.
 *
 * This was previously a pure claim check (this file's own prior revision, and still how
 * `ProjectClaim.Role`/`.IsProjectAdmin` are minted for the frontend's own client-side "what to show"
 * decisions — see api.js's isProjectAdmin()) — fixed here to close the drift against the .NET tier's
 * already-live-checked ProjectMemberAuthorizationHandler.cs.
