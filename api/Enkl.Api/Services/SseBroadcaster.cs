/// pre-formatted SSE frame into every matching connection's channel; EventsController's stream loop
/// is the only reader of each channel, so writes here are fire-and-forget from the caller's
/// perspective (never blocks a mutating request on a slow/stalled client).

/// Single-instance only: this holds state in the api process's memory, so it only sees connections on
/// this replica. Fine for the current single-`api`-container docker-compose setup; scaling `api` to
/// more than one replica would need a shared backplane (Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY is the natural fit
/// since Postgres is already the datastore) so a broadcast reaches connections held by other replicas.
